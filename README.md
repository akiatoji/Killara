## Deep Learning for Satellite Image Classification

This is a Manning Live Project that uses Semantic Segmentation to detect the outlines of surface water in satellite images. 

It covers Geo related topics (SRS, data collection) to deep learning combining U-Net (biomedical image segmentation convolution network) with ResNet.  Once trained (with limited data set), the model could detect surface water outline with 80-90% accuracy.

## Killara

[Killara](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Killara+NSW+2071,+Australia/@-33.7689872,151.1404025,6934m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b12a896aef226f7:0x5017d681632bc50!8m2!3d-33.76864!4d151.16347) is a suburb of Sydney where I lived decades ago. Killara is an aboriginal word that means permanent or always there.   I lived a few houses from the Roseville Park where I used to go watch the locals play cricket. The park is still there and they still play cricket.
